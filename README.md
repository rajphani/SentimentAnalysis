SentimentAnalysis


Sentiment Analysis is a field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that builds models that try to identify and classify attributes of the expression e.g.:

Polarity: if the speaker expresses a positive or negative opinion,
Subject: the thing that is being talked about,
Opinion holder: the person, or entity that expresses the opinion.
